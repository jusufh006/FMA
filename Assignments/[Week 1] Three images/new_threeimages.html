    <h3>Al-Aqsa</h3>
    <p>Al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as Masjid al-Aqsa, holds a place of profound significance in the Islamic faith.
        Situated in the heart of the Old City of Jerusalem, it is the third holiest site in Islam, following the Kaaba
        in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. The mosque, along with the Dome of the Rock, is a symbol of
        spiritual and historical importance for Muslims worldwide. It is believed to be the location from which the
        Prophet Muhammad ascended to the heavens during the Night Journey. The mosque complex encompasses a vast area
        with stunning architecture and a rich history dating back over a thousand years. Al-Aqsa remains a focal point
        of worship, pilgrimage, and cultural heritage, as well as a symbol of the enduring connection between the Muslim
        community and the city of Jerusalem.</p>

    <h3>Genocide has a name</h3>
    <p>Children in Gaza, Palestine, have endured the devastating effects of the conflict, leaving many without safe and
        stable buildings to call home. Israel, with its genocide, is drowning every day hundreds of children's lives,
        losing their childhood, leaving them without homes, destroying schools, hospitals, and vital infrastructure,
        leaving children and their families in conditions of life insecurity. Despite these difficulties, the resilience
        of Gaza's children shines through as they try to rebuild their lives and dreams of a brighter future,
        underscoring the urgent need for international support and efforts to ensure their well-being, safety and access
        to education.</p>

    <h3>The Unbroken Smiles of Palestinian Children Amidst Adversity</h3>
    <p>Childhood in Gaza, despite the harsh challenges of ongoing conflict, carries within it a precious treasure of
        happiness and hope. These children display an extraordinary strength and joy, even as they are surrounded by the
        destruction and aftermath of war. They find happiness in simple moments, such as playing with friends, enjoying
        their favorite food, or spending a Sunday at the beach. For them, school represents an opportunity to learn and
        dream of a brighter future. This childhood stands as a symbol of resilience and hope for a brighter day when
        peace and prosperity will prevail. While the war may have a profound impact on their lives, the children of Gaza
        continue to beautify the world with their smiles and their desire to change and improve their society.</p>
