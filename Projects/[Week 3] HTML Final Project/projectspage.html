                    Creating a website, we want to display hundreds of images in ten of pages. When things are like
                    this, we have to be more organized and thinks about where we put our images. At the moment, we can
                    create a new folder in "VSC", by called Images, inside our project folder, and then we put
                    profile.jpg there.

                    Creating a website, with new knowledge about tables, trying to recreate the following tables by
                    ourself in a single HTML file. I have learned that it is not neccessary to put only text inside
                    cells of a table. You can put images or even a whole other table inside them. Also, you don't have
                    to make the tables look good - that we will do later.

                    Creating a first website, with what i learned in first session about HTML, and using a valid HTML,
                    tags like headers, paragraph, and links. In this assignment I created a webpage which will
                    require to use the tools and knowledge what I got from the session and also do some research
                    online.
