                <p>
                    My name is Jusuf Hajdari, I am from the city of Gjilan, and I am 23 years old. I have a deep
                    passion for developing mobile applications, as well as websites. I have a degree in the Faculty of
                    Sociology from the University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina".

                    Also, I am a UI/UX Designer by profession, where I am certified by "BIT Academy". In addition to
                    two of my professions, I was lucky enough to have 11 years of work experience, where during these
                    years I exported different cultures, got to know a variety of people and developed a personal
                    perspective for career development.

                    <br><br>My plan for the future includes learning new languages, and building a successful career
                    in the field of technology and information. More precisely, I want to develop my skills as a
                    programmer and contribute to the creation of innovative technologies that have a positive impact on
                    people's lives. Such passions in the field of programming are among my first ambitions that have
                    given me the green light, and day by day just started to increase, I did not hesitate to read about
                    this profession that brings good benefits, and that develops you in your career.

                    <br><br>What distinguishes me from others is that I am one of them who wants to progress and
                    become one of the best, with an ambition that never stopped lining up, the other is that I learn
                    quickly, I am sociable, ambitious, I have good communication skills, team work, organization and
                    discipline, I manage my time very well and work fast. Something that interests me, I become
                    ambitious until I get what I want, and many other skills.

                    <br><br>I believe in my abilities and that tomorrow can be a way out or a key to develop my
                    career. So, from the essential values of my life are education and continuous professional
                    development. I'm always looking for ways to learn new things and increase my skills in the field of
                    technology,
                    specifically programming, so it seems that I recently managed to be in the right place, and with the
                    right mentor at "Future Minds Academy" following different courses and projects, we hope.

                    Passion for my activities outside of work is an important part of my identity and helps me stay
                    motivated and involved in life. Voluntary projects are an important part of my personal values,
                    I believe in helping others and the positive impact we can have on the community.
